"""Anchor state machines: when does the alarm fire?

Lessons encoded as defaults (each bought with a dead result in the paper):
- Anchors are COMPOSED by default: a circuit signal alone false-alarms wherever that
  circuit pays for the task itself (the trap-language rung: 10/10 false alarms); a
  behavioral ramp alone false-alarms on early transients. The same-evaluation
  conjunction was certified at 0 false alarms across 33 manufactured negatives.
- Crossings can require SUSTAINED evaluations (absolute-criterion events use 2).
- An anchor fires ONCE per run; that moment is the forecast anchor time.
